Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
-The Inception of High-Level Programming Languages (1950s):
Early computers were programmed using machine code, which was cumbersome and error-prone. The development of high-level programming languages like FORTRAN (1957) and COBOL (1959) revolutionized software engineering by allowing programmers to write code in a more human-readable form. These languages introduced concepts such as loops, conditional statements, and data structures, making software development more efficient and accessible.
-The Advent of Structured Programming (1970s):
In the 1970s, structured programming emerged as a methodology to improve software reliability and maintainability. It emphasized breaking down programs into smaller, reusable modules with clear control structures. Key figures like Edsger Dijkstra promoted structured programming principles, which led to the creation of languages like Pascal and C. This approach reduced the complexity of software systems and minimized the risk of errors.
-The Rise of Object-Oriented Programming (1980s-1990s):
Object-oriented programming (OOP) brought a paradigm shift to software engineering by organizing code around objects rather than functions. This approach encapsulates data and behavior within objects, promoting code reusability and modularity. Languages like C++ (1983) and Java (1995) became popular for their support of OOP principles, such as inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. OOP has since become a cornerstone of modern software development.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
-Planning: This initial phase involves defining the scope and purpose of the project, identifying resources, timelines, costs, and risks, and setting clear goals and deliverables.
-Requirements Gathering and Analysis: In this phase, detailed requirements are collected from stakeholders. This helps in understanding what the end users expect from the system and is crucial for ensuring the final product meets their needs.
-Design: Here, the system architecture is designed based on the gathered requirements. It includes creating system models, layouts, data flow diagrams, and designing both high-level and detailed system components.
lementation (or Coding): During this phase, the actual code for the system is written according to the design specifications. Developers work on building the software components and integrating them.
-Testing: This phase involves validating and verifying that the software works as intended. It includes various types of testing like unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT).
-Deployment: Once the software has been thoroughly tested and is deemed ready, it is deployed to a live environment where it can be accessed by end users. This phase may also include deploying updates and patches.
-Maintenance: After deployment, the software will need ongoing support and maintenance to fix any issues, update features, and ensure it remains secure and efficient over time.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
